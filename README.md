NGINX is a opensource web server written in C

Acts as a:

1. Web server - serves web content

2. Reverse-Proxy - some of the applications include:
++ Load Balancing
++ Backend Routing
++ Caching
++ API Gateway


Proxy - In this case, the client doesn't know which server/endpoint is servicing it's request.
Reverse Proxy - In this case, the server doesn't know whose request it is servicing. (reverse proxy example - nginx, ha-proxy etc.)
